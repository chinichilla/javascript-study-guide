## Javascript Study Guide

### The Basics

**Loosely vs. Strictly Equal**

### Context vs. Scope

**1. Context**

Scope - determines the accessibility of identifiers (e.g., variables) based off where it was created

Note: `window` is the global object in the browser 

TK

**2. Scope**

**3. `this` keyword and context**

**4. Closure**

**i. What is closure?**

Good Defn: the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (lexical environment) 

Layman's Terms: access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function

**ii. How is closure used?**

### Event Loop

**1. Overivew**
The asynchronous, single-threaded nature is not built into the JS language, but it's built on the core JS language inside the browser (or the programming environment) and accessed using the browser API's.

* **Heap** - a large mostly unstructured region of memory where objects are allocated
* **Stack** - a representation of the single thread provided for JS code execution 
* **Browser or Web API's** - these components are built into the web browser (or the computer environment) to provide extra functionality on top of JS (Note: the point of the API's is to abstract away the complexity involved and provide the extra capabilities)


**2. Promises or Async-Await**

### `eventListeners`

### The Different Engines 

QuickSort for Chrome, but it's a bit nuanced . Chrome's v8 engine uses a combination of QuickSort and InsertionSort for arrays (length < 10). Mozilla Firefox's SpiderMonkey uses MergeSort for stability.
