### Event Loop
The asynchronous, single-threaded nature is not built into the JS language, but it's built on the core JS language inside the browser (or the programming environment) and accessed using the browser API's.

TK

* **Heap** - a large mostly unstructured region of memory where objects are allocated
* **Stack** - a representation of the single thread provided for JS code execution 
* **Browser or Web API's** - these components are built into the web browser (or the computer environment) to provide extra functionality on top of JS (Note: the point of the API's is to abstract away the complexity involved and provide the extra capabilities)
